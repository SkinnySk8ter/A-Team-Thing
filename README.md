# A-Team-Thing
Making my team known to the world!

```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

This assignment was actually pretty tough! I still do not have a firm grasp on testing but with a bit more work I am sure to make sense of it eventually!

# To run
1. clone first!!

2. npm install
(may need to also install inquirer and fs!!)

3. node app.js

We were tasked with building a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests.
